#  Mini Weather STation

##  The project is designed to measure the temperature and humidity and output it on a display.

  This sketch demonstrates the use the DHT11 sensor and LCD module
  Using the LiquidCrystal and DFRobot_DHT11 library

  The circuit:
  LCD:
   LCD RS pin to digital pin 12
   LCD Enable pin to digital pin 11
   LCD D4 pin to digital pin 5
   LCD D5 pin to digital pin 4
   LCD D6 pin to digital pin 3
   LCD D7 pin to digital pin 2
   LCD R/W pin to ground
   10K resistor:
  DHT:
   ends to +5V and ground
   wiper/signal to LCD VO pin (pin 3)
